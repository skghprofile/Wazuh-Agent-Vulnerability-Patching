# Wazuh Agent Vulnerability Patching October 2024

## Overview of the Project

- This is a continuation of continuous monitoring for my home project SIEM and patching vulnerable applications I have installed on my systems.
- Since the last time I did this, I had to reinstall the server and endpoints due to technical problems.
- I also noticed that after updating Wazuh 4.7 to 4.9, the vulnerability section has been revamped, and the UI has changed from last time.
- Although the UI is different, the process for updating vulnerable applications still stays the same.

- Here is what the old UI looks like:
