# Wazuh Agent Vulnerability Patching March 2024

## Overview of the Project

- This project shows my documentation and thought process to patch vulnerabilities for both my personal PC using Windows 10 and a Kali Linux virtual machine from the vulnerabilities that my Wazuh SIEM found.
  - The Kali Linux machine is using Wazuh's Security Audit to find security vulnerabilities.
  - The Windows 10 PC is using Wazuh's vulnerability scanner to find published CVEs that are associated with programs installed on my PC.

Below is an image showing the two agents that are being used in this project.
